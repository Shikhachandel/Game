# Paddle and Ball Game
A user attempts to hit the bricks with a ball by giving it varied directions and not letting it fall down in this JavaScript-created game for platform 5 (P5).Additionally, I've included levels where a person's difficulty level will fluctuate and scores will be assigned accordingly.Three lives will be given.If you lose three lives, the game will restart at the same level but from the beginning, however if you just lose one life, the game will let you try again.
